PLOT 1: MONTE CARLO SIMULATION PATHS
{'='*60}

This plot visualizes a sample of individual price trajectories from the Monte 
Carlo simulation, showing the range of possible outcomes for {self.ticker} stock.

KEY INSIGHTS:

📊 Simulation Overview:
   • Total simulations run: {self.num_simulations:,}
   • Forecast period: {self.forecast_days} trading days (~3 months)
   • Starting price: ₹{initial_price:.2f}
   • Mean final price: ₹{final_mean:.2f}

📈 Path Distribution:
   • Paths ending above current price: {paths_above:,} ({pct_above:.1f}%)
   • Paths ending below current price: {paths_below:,} ({pct_below:.1f}%)
   
🎯 What the RED LINE Shows:
   The red line represents the MEAN PATH - the average price across all 
   {self.num_simulations:,} simulations at each time point. This is the most 
   statistically likely trajectory based on historical patterns.

📉 Volatility Analysis:
   • Average daily volatility: ₹{avg_volatility:.2f}
   • Final day volatility: ₹{final_volatility:.2f}
   • This shows how uncertainty increases over time

💡 INTERPRETATION:
   The spread of the blue paths illustrates the uncertainty in stock price 
   prediction. A wider spread indicates higher risk/volatility. The fact that 
   {pct_above:.1f}% of simulations end above the current price suggests a 
   {"bullish" if pct_above > 50 else "bearish"} outlook for the next 3 months.

PLOT 2: PRICE FORECAST WITH CONFIDENCE INTERVALS
{'='*60}

This plot shows the predicted price range over time with statistical confidence
intervals, helping you understand the probability distribution of future prices.

KEY INSIGHTS:

📊 Confidence Interval Explanation:
   • DARK BLUE (50% CI): There's a 50% probability the price will fall in this range
   • LIGHT BLUE (90% CI): There's a 90% probability the price will fall in this range
   • RED LINE: The mean (average) expected price path

📈 Final Day (Day {self.forecast_days}) Price Ranges:
   
   90% Confidence Interval:
   • Lower Bound (5th percentile):  ₹{final_p5:.2f}
   • Upper Bound (95th percentile): ₹{final_p95:.2f}
   • Range Width: ₹{ci_90_width:.2f} ({ci_90_range_pct:.1f}% of current price)
   
   50% Confidence Interval:
   • Lower Bound (25th percentile):  ₹{final_p25:.2f}
   • Upper Bound (75th percentile): ₹{final_p75:.2f}
   • Range Width: ₹{ci_50_width:.2f} ({ci_50_range_pct:.1f}% of current price)

🎯 Mid-Point Analysis (Day {mid_point} - ~1.5 months):
   • Expected price: ₹{mid_mean:.2f}
   • 90% CI Range: ₹{mid_p5:.2f} to ₹{mid_p95:.2f}

💡 INTERPRETATION:
   The widening of the confidence intervals over time reflects increasing 
   uncertainty in longer-term predictions. The 90% confidence interval suggests 
   that there's a 90% probability the stock price will be between ₹{final_p5:.2f} 
   and ₹{final_p95:.2f} after 3 months.
   
   {"⚠️  WARNING: The wide confidence interval indicates HIGH VOLATILITY/RISK." if ci_90_range_pct > 50 else "✅ The relatively narrow confidence interval suggests MODERATE VOLATILITY/RISK."}

PLOT 4: HISTORICAL STOCK PRICES
{'='*60}

This plot displays the actual historical price movements of {self.ticker} stock
over the past year (252 trading days), which formed the basis for our predictions.

KEY INSIGHTS:

📊 Historical Context:
   • Analysis Period: Past 252 trading days (~1 year)
   • Starting Historical Price: ₹{first_price:.2f}
   • Current Price: ₹{self.current_price:.2f}
   • This historical data was used to calculate:
     - Drift (μ): The average rate of return
     - Volatility (σ): The degree of price variation

🔄 Historical Pattern to Prediction:
   • The Monte Carlo simulation extends these historical patterns forward
   • Predicted mean price in 3 months: ₹{predicted_mean:.2f}
   • Projected change from current: {historical_to_predicted_change:+.2f}%

📈 Why This Plot Matters:
   
   1. PATTERN RECOGNITION:
      The historical chart reveals trends, support/resistance levels, and 
      volatility patterns that influence future price movements.
   
   2. MODEL FOUNDATION:
      All predictions are based on the statistical properties extracted from
      this historical data. The model assumes future volatility and drift will
      be similar to historical patterns.
   
   3. REALITY CHECK:
      Comparing predicted prices with recent historical prices helps assess
      if predictions are realistic or if they suggest unusual market conditions.

💡 INTERPRETATION:
   The historical price chart shows the actual market behavior that the Monte
   Carlo simulation attempts to model and project forward. Key observations:
   
   • The historical volatility pattern determines the width of confidence intervals
   • Recent trends may influence the predicted direction
   • Any unusual historical patterns (spikes, crashes) affect the model
   
   ⚠️  IMPORTANT LIMITATION:
   The model assumes that future price behavior will follow historical patterns.
   It CANNOT predict:
   • Unexpected news or events
   • Major corporate announcements
   • Market crashes or rallies
   • Changes in company fundamentals
   • Regulatory changes or economic shocks
